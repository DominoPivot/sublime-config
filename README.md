# sublime-config

This is my personal Sublime Text 3 configuration. In other words, it's all the settings files I keep in my User package.

Feel free to use this as an inspiration to make your own settings repository. It goes without saying that I don't hold any copyrights against a bunch of configuration files. I wouldn't recommend directly using this repository as your own config, because I'll be updating it to follow my mood.

Note that I do a lot of web development which is why I set tab to write 2 spaces by default. It's what I'm used to. However, because of how sublime-settings files are autoformatted when commands are used to change settings, I use tabs in my settings files.
